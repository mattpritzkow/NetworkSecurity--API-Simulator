# NetworkSecurity--API-Simulator
A mock API created to simulate test data for Auto Tourney, our senior project. I collaborated with Zachary Dean Dussaq to complete this project.

# What does this program do?
We first created a mock API that would produce sample user data which was identical to Call of Duty: Warzone's API. We used this tool to test Auto Tourney and spot out any bugs or deficiencies our tournament runner could have. We used this program for our network security final project in addition to a Python script, which would test our mock API's security with user data. The script would send HTTP requests to our RESTful API in order to obtain a user's game data. Common security practices implemented in our API prevented the attacker from stealing information. In turn, we created a threat/defense model that was highlighted in the curriculum throughout the semester.
